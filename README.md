# Nyx's Theme for Oh My Posh

![Example of prompt's colours](example.png)

How I make my terminal look nice using Oh My Posh. I use the Catppuccin Mocha
theme for the KDE Plasma Desktop on Linux and this makes my terminal prompt
match. I include the full Catppuccin Mocha pallette in the TOML file to make it
easy to mix and match to taste.
